# The Box

> _Code drifts into clouds<br>
> servers hum with open doors<br>
> free winds keep houses warm._

The Box is an open-source platform-as-a-service (PaaS) solution that enables developers to easily deploy, manage, and scale applications in a cloud environment. It provides a user-friendly interface and a variety of tools to streamline the application lifecycle, from development to production.

## Features

- [Easy Deployment](deployment.md): Deploy applications with just a few clicks.
- [Scalability](scaling.md): Automatically scale applications based on demand.
- [Monitoring](monitoring.md): Keep track of application performance and health.
- [Environment Management](enviroment.md): Manage configuration and environment variables effectively.
- [Backups](backups.md): Schedule and manage database backups with ease.
- [File Storage](storage.md): Handle file uploads and storage seamlessly.

## Why and How

The Box aims to provide a zero touch CD pipeline for developers, allowing them to focus on writing code rather than managing infrastructure.

It is built around best practices to provide simplicity and security, while providing you the freedom to customize anything you want.

The Box uses technologies most developers are already familiar with to lower the learning curve and speed up adoption.
No PhD in Kubernetes is required to deploy and manage applications, since we don't use it.
